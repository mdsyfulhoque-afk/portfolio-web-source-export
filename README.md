# Syful Hoque — Evidence to Systems

Updated 28 September 2026 on the isolated sunset-immersive-portfolio branch of the editable source repository.

This branch adds an original Sunset-informed visual system across the portfolio, uses a portrait supplied by Mohammad Syful Hoque locally in the hero, and retains the GSAP/ScrollTrigger film. The reference informed visual and engineering techniques; its brand, copy and assets were not copied. This source tree is the current version. Any ZIP already in the repository is a prior baseline and does not include these branch changes.

## Requirements and commands

- Node.js 22.9 or newer (the current release audit used Node.js 24.16.0)
- npm 11.16.0 (current audit; no third-party npm packages are required)

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run check
npm run start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`. `npm run dev` rebuilds and starts the local server. The generated `dist/` directory can also be deployed to a static host.

## Project map

- `build.mjs`: generates the site from the content record, templates and local resources.
- `content/portfolio.json`: editable structured portfolio source.
- `src/site.css` and `src/site.js`: responsive site design and browser behavior.
- `assets/`: self-hosted artwork, owner portrait, fonts, font licenses, GSAP and ScrollTrigger.
- `dist/`: generated site output, included for immediate review and deployment.
- `server.mjs` and `verify.mjs`: local preview server and route, asset, accessibility and cinematic-motion checks.
- `pod/`: evidence, asset, dependency, deployment and handoff notes.
- `vercel.json`: Vercel static deployment settings.

## Cinematic motion and accessibility

The homepage film pins during the scroll sequence. One persistent set of 48 fragments moves through six 3D arrangements, scene captions crossfade, the scene rail navigates the sequence, and the hero image has its own independent camera drift. GSAP and ScrollTrigger are bundled locally. Motion preference and viewport changes tear down or rebuild the animated tier. Reduced-motion, small-screen and script-unavailable users receive all six captions and diagrams in a static reading layout with ordinary page scrolling. The current animated caption is the only one exposed to assistive technology.

## Institutional buyer readiness

The site now includes a procurement and vendor-information route with four buyer personas, a checklist for procurement enquiries and explicit disclosure that roster status must be confirmed per opportunity. A separate quality and risk route describes engagement-level review steps, confidentiality boundaries, conflict handling and scope limits without claiming accreditation or independent audit. The homepage links buyers directly to both routes.

## Measurement boundary

The browser emits local `site:measurement` events for enquiry calls to action, prepared briefs and email/WhatsApp handoffs. These events do not include form content and are not transmitted or stored. No GA4, Search Console integration, CRM, cookie banner or nurture service is active. See `MEASUREMENT-PLAN.md` before connecting any analytics or follow-up provider.

## Editing content

Edit `content/portfolio.json` and the relevant templates, styles or scripts, then run `npm run build` and `npm run check`. `prepare-fonts.mjs` is optional maintenance tooling; it is not needed to install, build, run or deploy the site.

## Environment

No environment variable is required. Optional build-time `SITE_ORIGIN` sets canonical, sitemap and structured-data URLs for a deployment domain. `.env.example` documents the value; there is no dotenv dependency and `.env` is not loaded automatically.

## Deploy

For Vercel, import the repository and use the included configuration: build command `npm run build`, output directory `dist`. For another static host, build and publish `dist/`. Set `SITE_ORIGIN` before the build when the deployed canonical domain differs from the default site URL.

The optional `.openai/hosting.json` is preserved as original hosting metadata; the standalone website does not read or require it. The guarded `document.modelContext` helper is an optional host integration; the visitor-operated enquiry flow works without it.

## Services and limitations

The project has no backend, database, active analytics, CRM, email automation, payment or upload service. The enquiry form prepares a message for the visitor to review and hand off; it does not send or store a lead. The original hosted edition may have account-level access restrictions; this export runs independently on local Node or a conventional static host.
