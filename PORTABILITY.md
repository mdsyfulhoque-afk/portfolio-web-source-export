# Portability

This editable static-site project builds with Node.js built-in modules and runs independently of ChatGPT or the original Sites host. It requires no account session, database, API key or network download to render the website.

The current build produces 46 sitemap routes plus a 404 document, including buyer-specific procurement information and a quality-and-risk approach. The homepage’s GSAP film and hero drift use local libraries and honor changes to reduced-motion and viewport preferences while the page is open. If motion is disabled, all six scenes remain readable as static HTML and diagrams. The portrait and sculpture artwork are served from local assets.

## Clean setup

Requirements: Node.js 22.9+ and npm 11.16.0. From the repository root:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run check
npm run start
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`. The npm dependency graph is intentionally empty, so `npm ci` installs no third-party packages. `npm run dev` rebuilds before starting the preview server.

## Hosting

Run `npm run build`, then publish `dist/` to a static host. The included `vercel.json` configures the build command and output directory. Set optional build-time `SITE_ORIGIN` to the public HTTPS origin if the production domain differs from the default. `.env.example` documents this setting; the project does not load `.env` automatically.

## Runtime assets and integrations

Images, fonts, font licenses, GSAP and ScrollTrigger are local under `assets/`; the browser does not download required application assets from a CDN. The optional `document.modelContext.registerTool` integration is guarded and only registers a helper if a compatible host provides that API. It does not submit or store an enquiry; the regular form works without it. `.openai/hosting.json` is retained only as inert metadata and is not read by the standalone application.

The site dispatches a small set of local `site:measurement` browser events to support a future analytics integration. They contain page path, enquiry service or handoff channel only; they do not include visitor-entered fields, persist data or make network requests. No analytics provider is configured. `MEASUREMENT-PLAN.md` documents the activation boundary and KPI cadence.

## Not included

There is no backend, database, secret, private API, analytics account, CRM, newsletter service, payment system, file upload service or server-side lead submission. The site prepares a visitor-reviewed enquiry handoff, not a booking or submission. The original hosted edition's access rules are outside this portable project.
