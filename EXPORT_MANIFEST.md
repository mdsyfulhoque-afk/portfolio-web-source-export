The ZIP's file listing is the exact inventory. `node_modules`, `.git`, nested exports, staging directories and intermediate `.7z`/`.tar.gz` archives are excluded.

## Runtime and package inventory

- Node.js >=22.9; `.nvmrc` specifies Node 22. The clean-extraction audit used Node.js 24.16.0.
- npm 11.16.0; npm lockfile version 3.
- Third-party npm dependencies: none. The browser-side GSAP and ScrollTrigger files are included locally in `assets/`.
- Environment: optional build-time `SITE_ORIGIN`; no secret values or runtime secrets.
- Required external services for rendering: none. Required fonts, images and animation libraries are local.
- Measurement: the browser dispatches non-persistent local conversion events only; no analytics provider or transmission is configured.

## Assets

`assets/` includes the locally served hero artwork, Fraunces, Inter and IBM Plex Mono WOFF2 files and their license files, plus `gsap.min.js` and `ScrollTrigger.min.js`. `pod/evidence-sculpture-source.png` records the original image source. Generated `dist/` contains the referenced styles, scripts, images, fonts, route HTML and metadata. Site icons and the concise profile text are generated locally.

## Portability boundary

The optional `.openai/hosting.json` is inert hosting metadata, not an application dependency. The optional `document.modelContext` hook is feature-detected and guarded; without a compatible host, the ordinary browser enquiry preparation still works. There are no ChatGPT-only APIs required to build or render the standalone site. Local measurement events are ordinary browser `CustomEvent`s and send nothing to a network service.

## Exclusions and limitations

Secrets, `.env`, `node_modules`, `.git`, local packaging/QA work folders, prior ZIPs and tarballs, and the redundant `assets.7z` are excluded. No credentials are required. The project has no server-side submission or lead-storage backend, CRM, analytics, newsletter, payment, or upload service; documentation does not claim these exist.
